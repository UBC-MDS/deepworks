## The Developer's Monday

It's 9:00 AM. You sit down at your desk with a coffee that's already getting cold. Your inbox has 47 unread emails, Slack is buzzing, and you have a vague sense that something is due today.

**How will you survive?** Using the `deepworks` package, we can transform chaos into focused productivity.

### Starting the Day Right

Before diving into the abyss of notifications, let's get centered. The `get_affirmation` function provides personalized motivation based on your current state.

```{python}
from deepworks.affirmation import get_affirmation

# Monday morning reality check
name = "Developer"
mood = "stressed"
energy = 4  # Coffee hasn't kicked in yet

affirmation = get_affirmation(name=name, mood=mood, energy=energy)

print(f"Category: {affirmation['category']}")
print(f"\n\"{affirmation['text']}\"")
```

### Planning Your Focus Time

You have 2 hours before the standup meeting. Let's make them count with a structured work schedule using the Pomodoro technique.

```{python}
from deepworks.pomodoro import plan_pomodoro

# 2 hours of available time
available_minutes = 120

schedule = plan_pomodoro(total_minutes=available_minutes, technique="pomodoro")

# Calculate summary stats from the schedule
work_sessions = len(schedule[schedule["type"] == "work"])
total_work = schedule[schedule["type"] == "work"]["duration_minutes"].sum()
total_breaks = schedule[schedule["type"] != "work"]["duration_minutes"].sum()

print(f"Work sessions planned: {work_sessions}")
print(f"Total work time: {total_work} minutes")
print(f"Total break time: {total_breaks} minutes")
print()
schedule
```

The classic Pomodoro technique uses 25-minute work blocks with 5-minute breaks. But maybe you prefer longer focus sessions?

```{python}
# Try the 52-17 technique for deeper focus
deep_schedule = plan_pomodoro(total_minutes=available_minutes, technique="52-17")

print("52-17 Technique Schedule:")
deep_schedule
```

### Prioritizing the Chaos

Now let's tackle that to-do list. You have several tasks competing for attention. The `prioritize_tasks` function ranks them based on importance, effort, and deadlines.

```{python}
from deepworks.prioritize import prioritize_tasks
from datetime import date, timedelta

# Your Monday task list
today = date.today()

tasks = [
    {"name": "Fix critical bug in prod", "importance": 5, "effort": 2,
     "deadline": today.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")},
    {"name": "Review teammate's PR", "importance": 4, "effort": 1,
     "deadline": (today + timedelta(days=1)).strftime("%Y-%m-%d")},
    {"name": "Write unit tests", "importance": 3, "effort": 4,
     "deadline": (today + timedelta(days=5)).strftime("%Y-%m-%d")},
    {"name": "Update documentation", "importance": 2, "effort": 2,
     "deadline": (today + timedelta(days=7)).strftime("%Y-%m-%d")},
    {"name": "Refactor auth module", "importance": 4, "effort": 5,
     "deadline": (today + timedelta(days=3)).strftime("%Y-%m-%d")},
]

ranked_tasks = prioritize_tasks(tasks, method="weighted")
ranked_tasks[["name", "importance", "effort", "priority_score", "rank"]]
```

The weighted method balances importance (50%), effort efficiency (30%), and deadline urgency (20%). High importance + low effort + soon deadline = top priority.

What if deadlines are all that matter?

```{python}
# Pure deadline-based prioritization
deadline_ranked = prioritize_tasks(tasks, method="deadline")
deadline_ranked[["name", "deadline", "days_until_deadline", "priority_score", "rank"]]
```

### Taking a Break

You've completed two Pomodoro sessions. Your eyes are tired from staring at the screen, and your energy is dropping.

```{python}
from deepworks.breaks import suggest_break

# After 50 minutes of work, energy is flagging
minutes_worked = 50
current_energy = 3

break_suggestion = suggest_break(
    minutes_worked=minutes_worked,
    energy_level=current_energy,
    break_type="active",
    duration=5
)

print(f"Suggested Activity: {break_suggestion['name']}")
print(f"Duration: {break_suggestion['duration_minutes']} minutes")
print(f"Description: {break_suggestion['description']}")
```

Feeling more introspective? Try a mindful break.

```{python}
mindful_break = suggest_break(
    minutes_worked=90,
    energy_level=4,
    break_type="mindful",
    duration=10,
    seed=42  # For reproducibility
)

print(f"Mindful Activity: {mindful_break['name']}")
print(f"Location: {mindful_break['location']}")
print(f"Description: {mindful_break['description']}")
```

### The Full Workflow

Putting it all together, here's a complete morning productivity session:

```{python}
from deepworks.affirmation import get_affirmation
from deepworks.pomodoro import plan_pomodoro
from deepworks.prioritize import prioritize_tasks
from deepworks.breaks import suggest_break

# Step 1: Get motivated
print("=== MORNING MOTIVATION ===")
motivation = get_affirmation(name="Developer", mood="tired", energy=5)
print(f"\"{motivation['text']}\"\n")

# Step 2: Plan the session
print("=== TODAY'S SCHEDULE ===")
my_schedule = plan_pomodoro(total_minutes=90, technique="pomodoro")
work_count = len(my_schedule[my_schedule["type"] == "work"])
work_mins = my_schedule[my_schedule["type"] == "work"]["duration_minutes"].sum()
break_mins = my_schedule[my_schedule["type"] != "work"]["duration_minutes"].sum()
print(f"Sessions: {work_count} work blocks")
print(f"Format: {work_mins}min work / {break_mins}min breaks\n")

# Step 3: Know what to work on
print("=== PRIORITY TASKS ===")
my_tasks = [
    {"name": "Ship feature X", "importance": 5, "effort": 3},
    {"name": "Code review", "importance": 4, "effort": 1},
    {"name": "Team meeting prep", "importance": 3, "effort": 2},
]
priorities = prioritize_tasks(my_tasks, method="weighted")
for _, task in priorities.iterrows():
    print(f"  {int(task['rank'])}. {task['name']} (score: {task['priority_score']:.1f})")

# Step 4: Scheduled break
print("\n=== BREAK TIME ===")
my_break = suggest_break(minutes_worked=25, energy_level=6, break_type="any", duration=5)
print(f"Activity: {my_break['name']}")
print(f"Instructions: {my_break['description']}")
```

You've now got the tools to turn any chaotic workday into a focused, productive session. Go ship some code!
