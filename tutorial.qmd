## The Developer's Monday

It's 9:00 AM. You sit down at your desk with a coffee that's already getting cold. Your inbox has 47 unread emails, Slack is buzzing, and you have a vague sense that something is due today.

**How will you survive?** Using the `deepworks` package, we can transform chaos into focused productivity.

### Starting the Day Right

Before diving into the abyss of notifications, let's get centered. The `get_affirmation` function provides personalized motivation based on your current state.

```{python}
from deepworks.affirmation import get_affirmation

# Monday morning reality check
name = "Developer"
mood = "stressed"
energy = 4  # Coffee hasn't kicked in yet

affirmation = get_affirmation(name=name, mood=mood, energy=energy)

print(f"Category: {affirmation['category']}")
print(f"\n\"{affirmation['text']}\"")
```
